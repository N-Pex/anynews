Prototype concept of an "News Lite" mobile progressive web app:

Fully mirrors feeds, media from RSS capable CMS server to any static host /
mirror / CDN / IPFS / collateral freedom repo, then using PWA features
enable automated offline use, native icon, etc. Also great UX for
accessing over proxies/Tor/PT's, as it is speedy to navigate once the
feed is loaded.
